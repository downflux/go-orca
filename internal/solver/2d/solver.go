// function has a single root.

// all constraints are linear, we relax this assumption slightly and effectively
// allow specifying per-constraint bounds.
//
// This is useful for e.g. when the bounded constraint is circular, as in the
// case of solving an LP problem in velocity-space with a maximum speed
// constraint. We can model the circular constraint as a series of linear
// constraints which lie tangent to the circle-constraint intersection. To make
// this slightly more efficient, we can instead just truncate the intersection
// of each "real" constraint to be fully bounded by the circle-constraint
